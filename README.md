Hi!

This is Marcox Mediran's Mario50: Rebooted!

Mario50: Rebooted is a desktop/laptop game made using the game engine, Unity.
With Unity, this game can run on different platforms such as Windows, Mac, or Linux.

This is an improved remake of one of the game made on CS50x's Games Track called Mario.
Instead of the Love2D Framework, I decided to rewrite the game using the programming languange, C#.
Learning C# is a bit easy for me for I have background with C from this course and the making of the game was a breeze!
I tried to use this as my Final Project as I'm in love with making games.
After I finish this course, I would like to take CS50's Game Development Course if I have spare time.
This was also the first game I made. I used Unity's provided Documentation to learn more about it's Scripting API.

Here are the in-game controls:
1. Press 'space' to jump.
2. Press 'a' and 'd' to move left and right respectively.
3. Press 's' to crouch'.
4. Press 'Escape' key to quit the game anytime.

These are the improvements I made in the game:
1. More Powerful Game Engine - Unity.
2. Improved Camera Follow Script.
3. Level is based on Mario's 1-1 Level.
4. Added the ability to crouch.
5. Falling inside the pits or gaps between blocks causes the player to respawn to it's first location.

I would like to talk Sir David Malan and the CS50 staff for the wonderful adventure and challenges they gave me within this course.
This course inspired me to take Computer Science when I enter college.

This is all about my Final Project!
